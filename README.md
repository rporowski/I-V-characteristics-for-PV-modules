Predicting I-V Characteristics of Photovoltaic (PV) Modules using Neural Networks
This project demonstrates the application of neural networks to predict the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The I-V characteristics are critical for understanding the performance of PV modules under varying environmental conditions. This project implements a fully connected feed-forward neural network to model these characteristics, based on a dataset of PV module parameters.

Features
Neural Network Architecture: Implements a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with:

An input layer for environmental parameters (e.g., irradiance, temperature).
One or more hidden layers with ReLU activation for feature extraction.
An output layer predicting the current and voltage values.
Dataset Preprocessing:

Scaling and normalization of input features for better training performance.
Splitting the data into training and test sets.
Training and Evaluation:

Uses the mean squared error (MSE) loss function for regression.
Tracks training and validation losses to ensure proper convergence.
Visualization:

Plots of predicted versus actual I-V characteristics for model evaluation.
Visual comparison of training and validation performance.
