Photovoltaic modules should pass series of tests and examinations, verifying the electrical and
thermal characteristics of the module, before being released to the market, examining the properties of the
modules should undergo appropriate durability and efficiency tests under real outdoor conditions with
exposure to climatic conditions and under laboratory conditions. The performance of photovoltaic cells
depends on many factors, such as solar irradiance, module operating temperature, installation location,
weather conditions and module shading. In this paper, three selected photovoltaic modules were examined
using a large-scale steady-state solar simulator. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the photovoltaic
modules were experimentally tested and analyzed. The next step was to implement a three-layer artificial
neural network model (MLP). The experimental data obtained in the previous step coupled with output data
from MLP were then used in global sensitivity analysis (GSA). Experiments carried out on a large-scale
stationary solar simulator showed differences between the values declared by the manufacturer and the values
obtained from measurements of PV modules. The first module tested achieved the maximum power point
greater than that specified by the manufacturer, while the other two showed power drops; it was 85-87% for
the second module, and 95-98% for the third, respectively. The performed global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for
the MLP model showed that the parameters: eff (22.9) and Voc/V (14.19) have the largest effect on the powervoltage
relationship, while U (7.29) has the smallest effect. The usefulness of machine learning (ML) methods
in the comparative analysis of PV modules has been proved.
